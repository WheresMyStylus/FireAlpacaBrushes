# FireAlpacaBrushes
A repository of firealpaca script brushes.

To install each of the brushes listed here, open FireAlpaca and click the "S" button.

From there, you will be asked to select a file. Select the brush you want, and it will be installed. You can find it on the bottom of your brush list.

These brushes are free to edit and use as you please. To edit a brush, open the .bs file in any text editor. You will need to reinstall the brush after any changes.

These brushes are designed for use with FireAlpaca, but should work with Medibang as well.
